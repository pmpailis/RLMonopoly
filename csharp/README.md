 RLMonopoly
=================

RLMonopoly is a C# implementation of the board game Monopoly accompanied with an environment specification for Reinforcement Learning experiments.

In this version ( alpha ) the environment and the agent are fully functional but the GUI is not actively bound to the procedures running in the background.

Moving towards beta version :

- Massive improvements on GUI 
- Update project so that it works on a server/client protocol.
- Enable user to change settings dynamically
